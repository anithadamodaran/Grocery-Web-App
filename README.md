# Grocery-Web-App
Creating a full-stack Grocery Web App using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, angular, and Node.js) is a great way to build a scalable and dynamic application. 

Key Features for the Grocery Web App:

User Authentication (Signup/Login/Logout) using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Grocery Item Management (CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Add to Cart and Checkout functionality.

Order History and tracking.

Admin Panel to manage grocery items.

Responsive Frontend using angular.

Backend API using Express.js and Node.js.

Database for storing user data, grocery items, and orders (MongoDB).

Frontend:

   Each component is a separate page or feature within the application. 
   HomeComponent: A welcoming page that shows a list of featured grocery items or promotions.
   LoginComponent: A page for user login.
   SignupComponent: A page for user registration.
   GroceryItemsComponent: A page that displays available grocery items from the database.
   CartComponent: A page that shows items the user has added to their cart and allows for checkout.

User Authentication (Login/Signup)
   LoginComponent: Users log in with their email and password. 
   SignupComponent: Users can register a new account by providing their name, email, and password.
   Upon successful registration, they are redirected to the login page.

Display Grocery Items:
    GroceryItemsComponent displays a list of grocery items fetched from the backend.
    Each item includes its name, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button to add it to the shopping cart.

Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

1. User Authentication:
    User Model (models/User.js): Defines the user schema with fields like name, email, password, and role. 
    Auth Routes (routes/auth.js): Handles login and registration endpoints, using JWT to authenticate users.

By combining Angular for the frontend and Node.js/Express/MongoDB for the backend. 
You can build a full-fledged Grocery Web App with the following functionalities:

Conclusion:

Authentication (Login/Signup using JWT).
  -Grocery Item Management (CRUD operations for products).
  -Cart and Checkout system.
  -Order History and management.
  -Admin Panel for grocery item and order management.
By following the steps above, you should be able to create a scalable, full-stack application.
